- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Annica!
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in game coding and any type of problem solving for projects!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning a bit of gaming graphics and search algorithms in AI.

  I love learning new things and facing challanges to help my skills grow. I find the end result when code works correctly super satisfying!
